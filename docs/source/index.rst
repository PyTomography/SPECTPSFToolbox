SPECTPSFToolbox Documentation
===========================================

The ``SPECTPSFToolbox`` is a collection of python functions and classes that can be used for modeling the point spread functions (PSFs) of gamma cameras. The PSF models developed by the toolbox can be saved and used in `PyTomography <https://pytomography.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for SPECT image reconstruction.

In traditional SPECT reconstruction, only the geometric component of the PSF is considered; this library provides a means for modeling the septal scatter and septal penetration components, permitting more accurate image reconstruction when these components are significant.

Installation
