abstract = {There is a need for mathematical modelling for the evaluation of important parameters for photon imaging systems. A Monte Carlo program which simulates medical imaging nuclear detectors has been developed. Different materials can be chosen for the detector, a cover and a phantom. Cylindrical, spherical, rectangular and more complex phantom and source shapes can be simulated. Photoelectric, incoherent, coherent interactions and pair production are simulated. Different detector parameters, e.g. the energy pulse-height distribution and pulse pile-up due to finite decay time of the scintillation light emission, can be calculated. An energy resolution of the system is simulated by convolving the energy imparted with an energy-dependent Gaussian function. An image matrix of the centroid of the events in the detector can be simulated. Simulation of different collimators permits studies on spatial resolution and sensitivyt. Comparisons of our results with experimental data and other published results have shown good agreement. The usefulness of the Monte Carlo code for the accurately simulation of important parameters in scintillation camera systems, stationary as well as SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) systems, has been demonstrated.}

abstract={Bone single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging suffers from poor spatial resolution, but the image quality can be improved during SPECT reconstruction by using anatomical information derived from CT imaging. The purpose of this work was to compare two different anatomically guided SPECT reconstruction methods to ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) which is the most commonly used reconstruction method in nuclear medicine. The comparison was done in terms of lesion quantitation and lesion detectability. Anatomically guided Bayesian reconstruction (AMAP) and kernelized ordered subset expectation maximization (KEM) algorithms were implemented and compared against OSEM. Artificial lesions with a wide range of lesion-to-background contrasts were added to normal bone SPECT/CT studies. The quantitative accuracy was assessed by the error in lesion standardized uptake values and lesion detectability by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve generated by a non-prewhitening matched filter. AMAP and KEM provided significantly better quantitative accuracy than OSEM at all contrast levels. Accuracy was the highest when SPECT lesions were matched to a lesion on CT. Correspondingly, AMAP and KEM also had significantly better lesion detectability than OSEM at all contrast levels and reconstructions with matching CT lesions performed the best. Quantitative differences between AMAP and KEM algorithms were minor. Visually AMAP and KEM images looked similar. Anatomically guided reconstruction improves lesion quantitation and detectability markedly compared to OSEM. Differences between AMAP and KEM algorithms were small and thus probably clinically insignificant.},

title = {CASToR: a generic data organization and processing code framework for multi-modal and multi-dimensional tomographic reconstruction},
journal = {Physics in Medicine & Biology},
abstract = {In tomographic medical imaging (PET, SPECT, CT), differences in data acquisition and organization are a major hurdle for the development of tomographic reconstruction software. The implementation of a given reconstruction algorithm is usually limited to a specific set of conditions, depending on the modality, the purpose of the study, the input data, or on the characteristics of the reconstruction algorithm itself. It causes restricted or limited use of algorithms, differences in implementation, code duplication, impractical code development, and difficulties for comparing different methods. This work attempts to address these issues by proposing a unified and generic code framework for formatting, processing and reconstructing acquired multi-modal and multi-dimensional data.

The proposed iterative framework processes in the same way elements from list-mode (i.e. events) and histogrammed (i.e. sinogram or other bins) data sets. Each element is processed separately, which opens the way for highly parallel execution. A unique iterative algorithm engine makes use of generic core components corresponding to the main parts of the reconstruction process. Features that are specific to different modalities and algorithms are embedded into specific components inheriting from the generic abstract components. Temporal dimensions are taken into account in the core architecture.

The framework is implemented in an open-source C++ parallel platform, called CASToR (customizable and advanced software for tomographic reconstruction). Performance assessments show that the time loss due to genericity remains acceptable, being one order of magnitude slower compared to a manufacturer’s software optimized for computational efficiency for a given system geometry. Specific optimizations were made possible by the underlying data set organization and processing and allowed for an average speed-up factor ranging from 1.54 to 3.07 when compared to more conventional implementations. Using parallel programming, an almost linear speed-up increase (factor of 0.85 times number of cores) was obtained in a realistic clinical PET setting. In conclusion, the proposed framework offers a substantial flexibility for the integration of new reconstruction algorithms while maintaining computation efficiency.}

journal = {Physics in Medicine & Biology},
abstract = {Converging beam collimator geometries offer improved tradeoffs between resolution and noise for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The major factor limiting the resolution in SPECT is the collimator-detector response blurring. In order to compensate for this blurring it is useful to be able to calculate the collimator response function. A previous formulation presented a method for calculating the response for parallel and converging beam collimators that assumed that the shape of the holes did not change over the face of the collimator. However, cast collimators are fabricated using pins with a constant cross-section (shape perpendicular to the pin axis). As a result, due to the angulation of the pins, the holes made by these pins have shapes on the front and back faces of the collimator that change with position. This change in hole shape is especially pronounced when the angle between the collimator hole and the collimator normal is large, as is the case for half-fan-beam or short-focal-length collimators. This paper presents a derivation of a modification to the original method that accounts for the change in shape of the collimator holes. The method has been verified by comparing predicted line spread functions to experimentally measured ones for a collimator with a maximum hole angle of  with respect to the normal. This formulation is useful for predicting the response of fan-beam collimators in the design process and for use in detector response compensation algorithms.}

This closed form accounts for the known efficiency and resolution formulae for parallel beam, fan beam, cone beam and astigmatic collimators as well as for the most frequent hole array patterns and hole shapes. The point spread function in the space domain for a certain collimator and source position can be calculated via a discrete fast Fourier transform. Beside the complete theoretical definition of the response of multihole collimators, this theory allows the definition of accurate models of the geometrical response for SPECT reconstruction and it is suitable for designing new collimators.}

	abstract = {Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. It is characterized by the presence of several biomarkers, including amyloid-β aggregates, which lead to oxidative stress and neuronal decay. Targeted α-therapy (TAT) has been shown to be efficacious against metastatic cancer. TAT takes advantage of tumor-localized α-particle emission to break disease-associated covalent bonds while minimizing radiation dose to healthy tissues due to the short, micrometer-level, distances traveled. We hypothesized that TAT could be used to break covalent bonds within amyloid-β aggregates and facilitate natural plaque clearance mechanisms. Methods: We synthesized a 213Bi-chelate{\textendash}linked benzofuran pyridyl derivative (BiBPy) and generated [213Bi]BiBPy, with a specific activity of 120.6 GBq/μg, dissociation constant of 11 {\textpm} 1.5 nM, and logP of 0.14 {\textpm} 0.03. Results: As the first step toward the validation of [213Bi]BiBPy as a TAT agent for the reduction of Alzheimer disease{\textendash}associated amyloid-β, we showed that brain homogenates from APP/PS1 double-transgenic male mice (6{\textendash}9 mo old) incubated with [213Bi]BiBPy exhibited a marked reduction in amyloid-β plaque concentration as measured using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent and Western blotting assays, with a half-maximal effective concentration of 3.72 kBq/pg. Conclusion: This [213Bi]BiBPy-concentration{\textendash}dependent activity shows that TAT can reduce amyloid plaque concentration in~vitro and supports the development of targeting systems for in~vivo validations.},
